# Analysis-of-Global-Terrorism-Data-Using-Python
This study examines global terrorist trends using data from the Global Terrorist Database. The primary goal is to categorize terrorist attacks based on fatalities and analyze temporal patterns to acquire insight into the severity and frequency of incidents across time. The data was preprocessed with Python to remove missing values and categorize attacks as Minor, Small, or Major. R used for visualization techniques such as scatter plots and moving averages were used to detect trends in attack severity. Furthermore, a linear regression model was used to examine the link between the year and the overall number of attacks, demonstrating a substantial increase trend in terrorist activity over time. The findings suggest that, while minor assaults remain the most common, the incidence of major attacks has steadily increased, highlighting the changing character of terrorism. This research provides policymakers and scholars with actionable information that will help them build measures to lessen the impact of terrorism and improve global security.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bdc7a0d-af5e-4098-a878-3e2b95be0032)
